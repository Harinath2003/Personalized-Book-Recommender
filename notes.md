### Diffrent Types of Recommender Systems 

##### 1. Popularity Based Recommendation System : 

A Popularity Based Recommendation System is a type of recommender system that suggests items to users based on the overall popularity of the items. 

Eg: - Trending Section on Youtube 
    - Trending on Twitter 
    - Top 100 Imdb movies 
    - Top 100 Songs of the year Radio/Youtube


##### 2. Content Based Recommendation System : 

A Content-Based Recommendation System is a type of recommender system that suggests items to users based on the features or attributes of items they have shown interest in. This approach relies on the similarities between items, which are typically derived from their content

##### 3. Collaborative filtering : 


Collaborative Filtering is a method used in recommendation systems that makes automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many users (collaborating). The underlying assumption of collaborative filtering is that if a person A has the same opinion as a person B on an issue, A is more likely to have B's opinion on a different issue than that of a randomly chosen person.

There are two main types of collaborative filtering: **user-based** and **item-based**.

###### User-Based Collaborative Filtering

User-based collaborative filtering recommends items to a user based on the preferences of other users who are similar to them.

###### Item-Based Collaborative Filtering

Item-based collaborative filtering recommends items to a user based on the similarity between items. This method is particularly useful when the number of users is much larger than the number of items.


##### 4. Hybrid Recommender System 

A Hybrid Recommendation System combines multiple recommendation techniques to leverage their complementary strengths and improve the quality of recommendations. 

- The goal is to mitigate the limitations of individual methods and enhance overall performance by using a mix of content-based, collaborative filtering, and sometimes other techniques like demographic or knowledge-based recommendations.
